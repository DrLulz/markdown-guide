HTML headings are produced by placing a number of hashes before the header
text corresponding to the level of heading desired (HTML offers six levels of
headings), like so::

    # First-level heading

    #### Fourth-level heading

This will render out into the following HTML tags:

.. code-block:: html

    <h1>First-level heading</h1>
    
    <h4>Fourth-level heading</h4>
